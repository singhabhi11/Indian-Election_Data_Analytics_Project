## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze large-scale election data and extract **meaningful insights** such as:
- Seats won by different political parties and alliances  
- State-wise and constituency-wise vote distributions  
- EVM vs Postal vote comparisons  
- Winning margins and top-performing candidates  
- Alliance-wise performance summaries across India

## 🏗️ Database Design

- Designed **relational schema** with **5 key tables**:
  1. `constituencywise_details`
  2. `constituencywise_results`
  3. `statewise_results`
  4. `statewise_results_analysis`
  5. `partywise_results`

- Established **foreign key relationships** between constituency, state, and party tables.
- Added computed and derived columns such as `party_alliance` for advanced analytics.

## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used

- **Data Definition (DDL):** Table creation, constraints, and relationships  
- **Data Manipulation (DML):** Inserting, updating, and transforming raw data  
- **Aggregations:** `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`  
- **Conditional Logic:** `CASE WHEN` for alliance classification  
- **Joins:** Inner, Left, and multi-table joins for relational insights  
- **Subqueries & CTEs:** Extracting top candidates and runner-ups  
- **Window Functions:** Ranking and comparison of candidates  
- **Data Enrichment:** Adding new analytical columns for deeper insights

## 📈 Analytical Insights

Some of the key analyses performed include:

| # | Analysis | Description |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Total Seats | Find total number of parliamentary seats |
| 2 | State-wise Seats | Seats available per state |
| 3 | NDA Alliance Performance | Seats won by NDA alliance parties |
| 4 | I.N.D.I.A Alliance Performance | Seats won by I.N.D.I.A alliance parties |
| 5 | Party-wise Seat Count | Seats won per party in each state |
| 6 | Alliance-wise Distribution | Seats won by alliances across all states |
| 7 | EVM vs Postal Votes | Compare total votes from both sources |
| 8 | Top 10 Candidates | Highest EVM votes across constituencies |
| 9 | Winner & Runner-Up | Find top 2 candidates in every constituency |
| 10 | Maharashtra Analysis | State-level party and alliance performance summary |

## 📝 Query Showcase (Example)

**Problem:** Which candidate won and which candidate was the runner-up in each constituency of State for the 2024 elections

#### Query
```sql
WITH RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT cd.constituency_id,cd.candidate,cd.party,
        cd.evm_votes,cd.postal_votes,cd.total_votes,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cd.constituency_id 
			ORDER BY cd.total_votes DESC) AS VoteRank
    FROM constituency_details cd
    JOIN constituency_results cr ON cr.constituency_id = cd.constituency_id
    JOIN statewise_results sr ON 
		sr.parliament_constituency = cr.parliament_constituency
    JOIN states s ON s.state_id = sr.state_id
    WHERE s.state = 'Maharashtra'
)
SELECT cr.constituency_name,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rc.VoteRank = 1 THEN rc.candidate END) AS Winning_Candidate,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rc.VoteRank = 2 THEN rc.candidate END) AS Runnerup_Candidate
FROM RankedCandidates rc
JOIN constituency_results cr ON cr.constituency_id = rc.constituency_id
GROUP BY cr.constituency_name
ORDER BY cr.constituency_name;
```
